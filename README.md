# DockerSpawner

**DockerSpawner** enables [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) 
to spawn single user notebook servers in Docker containers.


## Prerequisites

JupyterHub 0.7 or above is required, which also means Python 3.3 or above.

## Installation

Install dockerspawner to the system:

```bash
pip install dockerspawner
```


## Configuration

### Choose a spawner

Three basic types of spawners are available for dockerspawner:

- [DockerSpawner][ln-spawner-docker]: useful if you would like to spawn 
  single user notebook servers on the fly. It will take an
  authenticated user and spawn a notebook server in a Docker container
  for the user.

- [SwarmSpawner][ln-spawner-swarm]: same behavior as DockerSpawner, but
  launches single user notebook servers as Docker Swarm mode services
  instead of as individual containers. This allows for running JupyerHub
  in a swarm so that notebook containers can be run on any of multiple
  servers.

- [SystemUserSpawner][ln-spawner-sysusr]: useful if you would like to
  spawn single user notebook servers that correspond to the system's 
  users.
  
[ln-spawner-docker]: #dockerspawner
[ln-spawner-swarm]: #swarmspawner
[ln-spawner-sysusr]: #systemuserspawner

In most cases, we recommend using DockerSpawner. Use cases where you
may wish to use SystemUserSpawner are:

- You are using docker just for environment management, but are running
  on a system where the users already have accounts and files they
  should be able to access from within the container. For example, you
  wish to use the system users and user home directories that
  already exist on a system.
- You are using an external service, such as nbgrader, that relies on 
  distinct unix user ownership and permissions.
  
If neither of those cases applies, DockerSpawner is probably the right
choice.


### DockerSpawner

Tell JupyterHub to use DockerSpawner by adding the following line to 
your `jupyterhub_config.py`:

```python
    c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'dockerspawner.DockerSpawner'
```

There is a complete example in [examples/oauth](examples/oauth) for
using GitHub OAuth to authenticate users, and spawn containers with docker.

### SwarmSpawner

Tell JupyterHub to use SwarmSpawner by adding the following line to
your `jupyterhub_config.py`:

```python
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'dockerspawner.SwarmSpawner'
```

You need to make sure that the JupyterHub process is launched on a Swarm manager
node, since its node needs to have permission to launch new Swarm services. It also
needs to have the docker socket mounted (like DockerSpawner) to communicate out of its
own container with the host's docker server. You can accomplish this in your
`docker-compose.yml` with the following settings:

```yml
jupyterhub:
  image: jupyterhub/jupyterhub
  # This is necessary to prevent the singleton hub from using its service number as its hostname
  hostname: jupyterhub
  # Permit communication with the host's docker server
  volumes:
    - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
  # Ensure Hub and Notebook servers are on the same network
  networks:
    - jupyterhub_network
  environment:
    DOCKER_NETWORK_NAME: jupyterhub_network
  # Ensure that we execute on a Swarm manager
  deploy:
    replicas: 1
    placement:
      constraints:
        - node.role == manager
```

You'll also need to ensure that the JupyterHub service and the launched single-user
services all run on the same Swarm overlay network. You can create one easily using:

```
docker network create --driver overlay jupyterhub_network
```

Then use this network in your jupyterhub_config.py like the following example:

```python
network_name = os.environ['DOCKER_NETWORK_NAME']
c.SwarmSpawner.network_name = network_name
c.SwarmSpawner.extra_host_config = {'network_mode': network_name}
```

Unless otherwise noted, SwarmSpawner supports the same configuration options as DockerSpawner.

### SystemUserSpawner

If you want to spawn notebook servers for users that correspond to system users,
you can use the SystemUserSpawner instead. Add the following to your
`jupyterhub_config.py`:

```python
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'dockerspawner.SystemUserSpawner'
```

The SystemUserSpawner will also need to know where the user home directories
are on the host. By default, it expects them to be in `/home/<username>`, but if
you want to change this, you'll need to further modify the
`jupyterhub_config.py`. For example, the following will look for a user's home
directory on the host system at `/volumes/user/<username>`:

```python
c.SystemUserSpawner.host_homedir_format_string = '/volumes/user/{username}'
```

For a full example of how `SystemUserSpawner` is used, see the
[compmodels-jupyterhub](https://github.com/jhamrick/compmodels-jupyterhub)
repository (this additionally runs the JupyterHub server within a docker
container, and authenticates users using GitHub OAuth).

### Using Docker Swarm (not swarm mode!)

**Note:** This is the older Docker Swarm, which makes a swarm look like a single docker instance.
For the newer Docker Swarm Mode, see [SwarmSpawner][ln-spawner-swarm]. This used to be supported by
[cassinyio](https://github.com/cassinyio/SwarmSpawner), but this repository has been deprecated.

Both `DockerSpawner` and `SystemUserSpawner` are compatible with
[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/) when multiple system
nodes will be used in a cluster for JupyterHub. Simply add `0.0.0.0`
to your `jupyterhub_config.py` file as the `host_ip`:

```python
c.DockerSpawner.host_ip = "0.0.0.0"
```

This will configure DockerSpawner and SystemUserSpawner to get
the container IP address and port number using the `docker port`
command.

### Data persistence and DockerSpawner

With `DockerSpawner`, the user's home directory
is *not* persistent by default, so some configuration is required to do so unless
the directory is to be used with temporary or demonstration JupyterHub
deployments.

The simplest version of persistence to the host filesystem is to
isolate users in the filesystem, but leave everything owned by the same
'actual' user with DockerSpawner. That is, using docker mounts to
isolate user files, not ownership or permissions on the host.

Volume mapping for DockerSpawner in `jupyterhub_config.py`
is required configuration for persistence. To map volumes from 
the host file/directory to the container (referred to as guest)
file/directory mount point, set the `c.DockerSpawner.volumes` to specify
the guest mount point (bind) for the volume.

If you use `{username}` in either the host or guest file/directory path,
username substitution will be done and `{username}` will be replaced with
the current user's name.

(Note: The jupyter/docker-stacks notebook images run the Notebook server as user
`jovyan` and set the user's notebook directory to `/home/jovyan/work`.)


```python
# Explicitly set notebook directory because we'll be mounting a host volume to
# it.  Most jupyter/docker-stacks *-notebook images run the Notebook server as
# user `jovyan`, and set the notebook directory to `/home/jovyan/work`.
# We follow the same convention.
notebook_dir = os.environ.get('DOCKER_NOTEBOOK_DIR') or '/home/jovyan/work'
c.DockerSpawner.notebook_dir = notebook_dir

# Mount the real user's Docker volume on the host to the notebook user's
# notebook directory in the container
c.DockerSpawner.volumes = { 'jupyterhub-user-{username}': notebook_dir }
```

The [`jupyterhub-deploy-docker`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-docker) repo
contains a reference deployment that persists the notebook directory; 
see its [`jupyterhub_config.py`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-docker/blob/master/jupyterhub_config.py)
for an example configuration.

See Docker documentation on [data volumes] for more information on data
persistence. 

## Memory limits

If you have `jupyterhub >= 0.7`, you can set a memory limit for each user's container easily.

```
c.Spawner.mem_limit = '2G'
```

The value can either be an integer (bytes) or a string with a 'K', 'M', 'G' or 'T' prefix.

## Picking or building a Docker image

By default, DockerSpawner uses the `jupyterhub/singleuser` image
with the appropriate tag that pins the right version of JupyterHub.
Any of the existing Jupyter [docker stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks)
can be used with JupyterHub, provided that the version of JupyterHub in the image matches,
and are encouraged as the image of choice. Make sure to pick a tag!

```python
c.DockerSpawner.container_image = 'jupyter/scipy-notebook:8f56e3c47fec'
```

The docker-stacks are moving targets with always changing versions.
Since you need to make sure that JupyterHub in the image is compatible with JupyterHub,
always include the `:hash` tag part when specifying the image.


You can also build your own image.
The only requirements for an image to be used with JupyterHub:

1. it has Python >= 3.4
2. it has JupyterHub
3. it has the Jupyter `notebook` package
4. CMD launches jupyterhub-singleuser OR the `c.Spawner.cmd` configuration is used
    to do this.

For just about any starting image, you can make it work with JupyterHub by installing
the appropriate JupyterHub version and the Jupyter notebook package.

For instance, from the docker-stacks, pin your JupyterHub version and you are done:

```Dockerfile
FROM jupyter/scipy-notebook:8f56e3c47fec
ARG JUPYTERHUB_VERSION=0.8.0
RUN pip3 install --no-cache \
    jupyterhub==$JUPYTERHUB_VERSION
```

Or for the absolute minimal JupyterHub user image starting only from the base Python image:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.6
RUN pip3 install \
    jupyterhub==0.7.2 \
    'notebook>=5.0,<=6.0'

# create a user, since we don't want to run as root
RUN useradd -m jovyan
ENV HOME=/home/jovyan
WORKDIR $HOME
USER jovyan

CMD ["jupyterhub-singleuser"]
```

This Dockerfile should work with just about any base image in the FROM line,
provided it has Python 3 installed.
